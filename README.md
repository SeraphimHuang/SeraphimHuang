#### Web Development
- **Photography Equipment E-commerce**  
   Developed an e-commerce platform for photography equipment, adopting a microservices architecture and utilizing Node.js, Go, Spring Boot, Flask, and Kotlin to implement user authentication, product catalog, order processing, and payment functionalities.
   <details>
   <summary>More</summary>

   - Employed Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, built a RESTful API gateway with Nginx to route client requests, enhancing system modularity and scalability.
   - Accelerated the above calibration process through parallel computation in Python using the multiprocessing library.
   - Implemented centralized logging and monitoring using the ELK Stack, optimized inter-service communication with gRPC reducing network overhead by 20%.
   - Created an asynchronous notification service with Kotlin and Redis for real-time email and SMS notifications.

#### Quant Finance
- **ML-Enhanced Delta-Hedging Arbitrage**  
   Designed a delta-hedging arbitrage strategy and applied machine learning to enhance a synthetic options strategy.
   <details>
   <summary>More</summary>

   - Preprocessed tick-level commodity options data, calculated implied volatilities using Newton's method.
   - Accelerated the above calibration process through parallel computation in Python using the multiprocessing library.
   - Developed an arbitrage strategy trading implied volatility by delta-hedging (in backtesting, annualized return: 17%)
   - Employed Random Forest to enhance signals of an existing synthetic option strategy and tripled the per-trade return.
